For every word cloud, there are interesting things to notice.
However, we found that the best and most describing word clouds were for the genres _Hip-Hop_, _Country_ and _Reggae_.

**Hip-Hop**  
From the word cloud alone it is rather clear that the genre is _Hip-Hop_.
The words _wiggy_ (which is slang for 'emotional uncontrolled or weird'), _westside_ (which could be a reference to the original westcoast rap in America) and _thang_ (slang for thing) are some of the most unique words for the genre.
These words together with words such as _muthafuckin_, _bitchy_ and _skrrt_ all paint a rather clear picture of the _Hip-Hop_ genre.

**Country**  
With words such as _outback_, _hillbilly_ and _tailgate_ a very clear theme is showed.
The words in the word cloud give you the _hillbilly_ feeling of being on a farm, drinking beer out of your _chevrolets_ and _gunnin_.
The word cloud thus confirms a lot of the classical stereotypical ideas about what _Country_ music is about.

**Reggae**  
Most of the words in the word cloud can appear to be nonsense words, slang or sound words such as _dem_, _di_, _fi_ and _inna_.
This is however very typical for the _Reggae_ genre as it is very inspired by Ska, which originally is a Jamaican music genre.
Reggae therefore almost has its own terminology and sound words which are not used in other genres.
The word cloud thus paint a very good picture of some of the things _reggae_ is all about.
