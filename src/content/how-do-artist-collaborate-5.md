### Conclusion

After running the collaboration analysis we are able to asses how the factors studied influence artist collaborations.

When it comes to **_Popularity_**, the artists with a popularity ratio higher than 70% will most likely be among the top collaborators.
However, the correlation between the two is weak, thus the number of collaborations
does not rely directly on the popularity of the artists.

The **_Genres_** analysis allowed us to understand that the highest levels of collaboration are for the
_Hip-Hop_ artists. While the lowest level of collaborations were generally found among the genres _Alternative_, _Rock_ and _Punk_.
_Hip-Hop_ is furthermore the genre with the highest ratio of collaborations within itself.
Meaning that the _Hip-Hop_ artists collaborate more together than with artists from other genres.
This situation is similar for both _Reggae_ and _Country_.
When looking at the collaborations that between genres, it was found that
genres with similar charactheristics or origins would tend to collaborate more them.
This is the case for _Funk-Soul_ and _Hip-Hop_ artists as well as
for _Rock_, _Alternative_ and _Country_ artists.

With regards to **_Time_** the analysis showed that indeed the level of collaboration of an artist depends on the time period of the artist.
From 1960 to 2020 the average number of collaborations of an artists went from 2.5 to 20 equivelant to 8 time as many collaborations.
This increase in collaborations were however probably due to the increase of _Hip-Hop_ artists over time which as mentioned generally has the highest levels of collaborations.

The **_Sentiment_** analysis did not show clear results, with a low correlation ratio and no clear difference between the top collaborators and the rets of artists.
However, there are still interesting elements that the song lyrics and sentiment lyrics can show us.
Therefore, further analysis is conducted on the next page.
