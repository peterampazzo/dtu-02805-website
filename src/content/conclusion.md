To answer the question of how artists collaborate, a network of 3098 musicians from 8 different genres was constructed.
The analysis of the network showed that overall the artists which are popular tend to do more collaborations.
However, the level of collaboration also turned out to be dependant of the genre.
_Hip-Hop_ being the genre with generally the highest amount of collaborations while the lowest amount of collaboration was found among the genres _Alternative_, _Rock_ and _Punk_.
_Hip-Hop_ was also found to be the genre with the highest amount of collaborations within itself.
Meaning that _Hip-Hop_ artists collaborate more together than with other artists, which was similar for _Reggae_ and _Country_.
And, not so surprisingly, it was also found that genres with similar characteristics tend to collaborate more,
such as _Funk-Soul_ and _Hip-Hop_ as well as _Rock_, _Alternative_ and _Country_.

By further downloading song lyrics for all artists of the network and analysing the text, more characteristics were revealed.
Overall the saddest lyrics, accordingly to the sentiment analysis, were found to come from _Hip-Hop_ artists
while the happiest lyrics were associated with _Funk-Soul_.
This was further backed up by visualizing word clouds for each genre as these showed rather harsh words for exactly the _Hip-Hop_ genre.
To analyse further, the year of the songs and artist were also introduced.
This showed that from 1960 to 2020 the sentiment had overall fallen, meaning that generally, the lyrics of songs had become sadder with time.
By looking at the level of collaboration and year of an artist it was found that the average amount of collaborations for an artist went from 2.5 to 20,
being now eight times higher.
Meaning newer artists generally collaborate more.

All of these results are however based on just a small subset of artists and a few of their songs.
By choosing different artists and including more song lyrics the results and conclusion could change accordingly.
Furthermore, many of the conclusions are based on the genres of the artists which were constructed from the partitions of the genres network.
The chosen genres for every artist thus might not be always correct and the fact that artists can be in several genres is not taken into account,
which again might influence the results.


As a final feature below the network of collaborations for some of the favorite artists of the authors are showed.
