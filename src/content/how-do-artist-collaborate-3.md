The visualization shows how much each genre collaborates within itself or with other genres. By analysing the plot the following observations are made:

- The genres that reached to the highest degree, _Hip-Hop_ and _Reggae_, are the ones with the higher ratio of edges within the same genre; 64% and 47% respectively. This could indicate that to reach a higher number of collaborations it is important to have a strong proximity with artists from the same genre.
- _Country_ as well mostly collaborates within its genre with a ratio of 45%, almost the same as _Reggae_.
- _Pop_ artists collaborate a lot with _Hip-Hop_, in fact as much as they collaborate with artist from their genre.
- Surprisingly, _Punk_ artist collaborate a lot with _Hip-Hop_ artists,
  more than 30% of its collaborations were with _Hip-Hop_ artists.
- Similarly, the biggest collaborator for _Funk-Soul_ is by far _Hip-Hop_, with 51% of its collaborations. However,
  this is expected due to its proximity and shared origins.
- _Rock_ artist collaborate a lot with both _Alternative_ and _Country_ artists.
  However, this is also expected due to the proximity of between genres.

We can conclude that first of all the level of collaboration does seem to depend on the genre type,
and that artists within specifically _Hip-Hop_ tend to collaborate more.
Furthermore, it seems that while all genres do collaborate the level of collaboration between genres also greatly depends on the genre type.
The genres _Hip-Hop_, _Country_ and _Reggae_ for example collaborates a lot with artists within their genre
while a genre like _Punk_ collaborates just as much with several different genres.
