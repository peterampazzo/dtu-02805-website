Previously we looked into how the sentiment and level of collaboration were related, but we did not dive deeper into the sentiment which is why we will focus on this, to begin with.

| Placement |    Genre    | Avg. sentiment |
| --------- | :---------: | :------------: |
| 1.        |  Funk-Soul  |     5.616      |
| 2.        |   Country   |     5.541      |
| 3.        |     Pop     |     5.538      |
| 4.        |    Rock     |     5.536      |
| 5.        |   Reggae    |     5.522      |
| 6.        | Alternative |     5.509      |
| 7.        |    Punk     |     5.455      |
| 8.        |   Hip-Hop   |     5.423      |

The happiest genre is thus _Funk-Soul_ while the saddest genre is _Hip-Hop_.
By comparing with the word clouds it also makes sense that _Hip-Hop_ is the saddest genre as the word cloud for _Hip-Hop_ included several harsh words.
But as the difference from the happiest to the saddest genre is less than 0.2 it is hard to assess if the difference is significant.
Earlier however we saw that between the saddest and the happiest artist there was about 1.0 difference in sentiment, so let's see which artists are the happiest and the saddest.

**Happiest artists**

| Artist           |    Genre    | Sentiment |
| ---------------- | :---------: | :-------: |
| Hezekiah Walker  |  Funk-Soul  |   6.10    |
| Cheryl Lynn      |  Funk-Soul  |   5.94    |
| Mauro Picotto    |     Pop     |   5.93    |
| Gwen McCrae      |  Funk-Soul  |   5.92    |
| George McCrae    |  Funk-Soul  |   5.92    |
| Benny Benassi    |     Pop     |   5.92    |
| Shuggie Otis     |  Funk-Soul  |   5.89    |
| Jekalyn Carr     |  Funk-Soul  |   5.89    |
| Jill Scott       |  Funk-Soul  |   5.89    |
| Crystal Fighters | Alternative |   5.88    |

&nbsp;

The happiest artist of the network is _Hezekiah Walker_ who is an American gospel music artist who has track names such as _Grateful_ and _Amazing_, it thus makes sense that he is the happiest artist.
The band _Crystal Fighters_, an English-Spanish band characterized by its _progressive dance_ and folk style, is last on the list.
The band normally performs bare-foot in their concerts and dresses-up with feather crowns and other typical hippie ornaments.
Thus it is not a surprise, to find them between the happiest artists.

**Saddest artists**

| Artist              |  Genre  | Sentiment |
| ------------------- | :-----: | :-------: |
| Alvin Risk          |   Pop   |   4.97    |
| Tujamo              |   Pop   |   5.01    |
| Gabry Ponte         |   Pop   |   5.04    |
| Sheck Wes           | Hip-Hop |   5.09    |
| Motörhead           |  Rock   |   5.09    |
| Black Label Society |  Rock   |   5.12    |
| Herobust            |   Pop   |   5.13    |
| Bone Crusher        | Hip-Hop |   5.15    |
| Onyx                | Hip-Hop |   5.15    |
| Westside Connection | Hip-Hop |   5.15    |

The saddest artist in the network is _Alvin Risk_.
By looking through his discography and music style it does not completely make sense that he is the saddest artist.
But as most of his music is DJ styled electronic music it often repeats the same lyrics over and over again.
So if one of the chosen songs include one or several sad words this could explain his leading position on lower sentiment.
Besides _Alvin Risk_ the artists such as _Motörhead_, _Black Label Society_ and _Bone Crusher_ almost just from the names explains why they are among the 10 saddest artists.
In particular, _Black Label Society_, which is a hard-rock and heavy-metal band, characterized by its biker aesthetic,
with leather jackets, combat boots and studded belts.
Some of their latest albums include _Order of the Black (2010)_ and _Catacombs of the Black Vatican(2014)_.
Thereby it is not a surprise that they appear in the saddest artists list.
